This version uses the namespace "minion".
It uses no global variables for deserializing or serializing, using instances of the classes InputBuffer and DumpBuffer.

The basic structural node is MValue, which can be a string, a list or a map. There is also an empty value, which is not the result of a successful parse, and there are other possibilities which are used internally.

This is an attempt at a more traditional recursive descent parser. It uses (at present) shared pointers to manage memory.

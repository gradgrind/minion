This version uses the namespace "minion".
It uses no global variables for deserializing or serializing, using instances of the classes InputBuffer and DumpBuffer.

The basic structural node is MValue, which can be a string, a list or a map. There is also an error type, returned when a parse fails, providing an error message. For internal use there is also empty type.

This is an attempt at a fairly straight recursive descent parser. It uses shared pointers to manage memory, which has a slight efficiency penalty, but it looks like this is not too great and the convenience of the shared pointers might be a good trade off.
